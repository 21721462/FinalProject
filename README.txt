CITS3200 Project Deliverable C GroupD.
Project: Engineering Research Project Allocations
Completed: Semester 2 2018

This is the CITS3200 Project completed by Group D. The aim of this project was to create a web applciation for 
final year engineering students to be allocated to their research projects. The application includes 3 pages:

a) coordinator front end - found with extension '/coordinator' including all required functionality for a coordinator
to manage the allocations

b) student submission form - found with extension '/student' for students to submit preferences of projects

c) Academic Project Submission Form - found with extension '/project' for Academics to submit projects for students to complete.

Students are allocated to projects using an algorithm based off the old excel macro designed by ECM.
